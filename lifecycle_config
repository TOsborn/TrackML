# This script is run every time your SageMaker instance starts, and is necessary because installed packages and cloned repos are not saved when the instance is stopped. To use, paste this script into the “start notebook” window when creating your lifecycle configuration, and set the variables for your GitHub username (case-sensitive), password, and branch name (optional). Again, note that your local copy of the TrackML repo is not saved when the instance is stopped, so don’t forget to push to remote beforehand; otherwise you will lose changes.
